## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Used **mobile-first workflow** for the first time, i thought it would be a tough task but rather did it pretty fast and adapted to the flow.

### Continued development

Do more projects with the **mobile fast worflow** to gain more skills on it, also improve my JS skills with projects.
